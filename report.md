# Heart Disease Prediction Project Report

## Overview

This project focused on developing and evaluating various machine learning models to predict heart disease using a large healthcare dataset. With approximately 200,000 patient records and 20 features, the project aimed to identify the most effective prediction approach through comprehensive model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods.

## Dataset

The dataset included the following key features:
- Demographic information (Sex, AgeCategory)
- Health status indicators (GeneralHealth, BMI, WeightInKilograms)
- Medical history (HadAngina, HadStroke, HadCOPD, HadKidneyDisease, HadArthritis, HadDiabetes)
- Physical limitations (DeafOrHardOfHearing, BlindOrVisionDifficulty, DifficultyWalking, DifficultyDressingBathing, DifficultyErrands)
- Lifestyle factors (SmokerStatus, AlcoholDrinkers)
- Preventive measures (ChestScan, PneumoVaxEver)

The target variable was "HadHeartAttack" indicating whether a patient had experienced a heart attack.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Categorical variables were encoded appropriately
- Numerical features were standardized
- Dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

### Model Development
Six different machine learning approaches were implemented:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Naive Bayes
4. Random Forest
5. Gradient Boosting
6. Artificial Neural Network

Additional advanced modeling:
7. Stacking Ensemble (combining Random Forest, KNN, and Gradient Boosting)

### Model Optimization
- Grid search cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Detailed classification reports for comprehensive assessment

## Results

### Model Performance Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Stacking Ensemble | 92.54% | 90.74% | 94.73% | 92.69% |
| Random Forest (tuned) | 92.44% | 91.22% | 93.91% | 92.55% |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (tuned) | 89.49% | 85.86% | 94.54% | 89.99% |
| Gradient Boosting (tuned) | 89.58% | 90.29% | 88.70% | 89.49% |
| Logistic Regression | 77.28% | 79.32% | 73.78% | 76.45% |
| Artificial Neural Network | 78.24% | 80.00% | 76.00% | 78.00% |
| Naive Bayes | 73.96% | 77.60% | 67.31% | 72.09% |

### Key Findings

1. **Tree-based models performed best**: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting demonstrated superior performance, suggesting the importance of capturing non-linear relationships and feature interactions in heart disease prediction.

2. **Ensemble methods provided additional value**: The stacking ensemble achieved the highest overall F1 score (92.69%), demonstrating the benefit of combining multiple modeling approaches.

3. **High recall rates in top models**: The best models achieved recall rates above 93%, indicating excellent ability to identify potential heart disease cases.

4. **Hyperparameter tuning impact varied**: While Gradient Boosting showed significant improvement after tuning (+8.63% F1 score), Random Forest exhibited minimal change, suggesting its default parameters were already well-optimized.

5. **Neural network underperformed**: Despite the large dataset, the ANN didn't outperform traditional machine learning approaches, suggesting that the current architecture may be insufficient or that the problem doesn't necessarily benefit from deep learning.

## Conclusion

The stacking ensemble of Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting provided the most effective approach for heart disease prediction, with Random Forest serving as a strong alternative when simpler deployment is preferred. These models demonstrated excellent recall rates, making them particularly valuable for clinical screening where identifying potential heart disease cases is critical.

## Recommendations

1. **Implementation Strategy**: Deploy the stacking ensemble as the primary model, with the tuned Random Forest as a backup or simplified alternative.

2. **Clinical Application**: Prioritize models with high recall rates for screening applications to minimize missed cases.

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Explore feature engineering to potentially improve model performance
   - Investigate more complex neural network architectures and extensive hyperparameter tuning
   - Consider developing specialized models for different demographic groups

4. **Deployment Considerations**: Implement regular monitoring and retraining procedures to maintain model accuracy as new data becomes available.

This project demonstrates that ensemble methods combining multiple modeling approaches offer the most promising solution for heart disease prediction, providing an effective balance of precision and recall for clinical decision support.
